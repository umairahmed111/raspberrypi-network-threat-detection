# Raspberry Pi–Based Network Threat Detection & Attack Observation System

## End Goal
(One paragraph — fixed forever)
Design and implement a Raspberry Pi–based network monitoring system that passively captures network traffic, identifies suspicious connection behavior, logs potential intrusion attempts, and analyzes attacker patterns using real-world data collected from an exposed system.

## Day 0 – Environment Setup
**What I did:**
- Installed Raspberry Pi OS Lite
- Configured SSH
- Identified network interface

**What broke / confused me:**
- SSH connection initially failed

**What I learned:**
- Headless setup requires SSH + network readiness

**Open questions:**
- Why did SSH fail initially?
